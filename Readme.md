# KidnessX86 Technical test
### Here is a little technical test which we need to roughly evaluate your .NET Core / React abilities in some simple tasks. You can make additional improvements to the code for extra points.
### Please create a Word/OpenOffice document with your code snippets, comments, answers and screenshots if applicable and send it to us. :)

## Contents:
### 1. Bubble Sort
#### There is an issue with the bubble sort so it doesn't return correct collection. Can you find it?
### 2. Date Formatting
#### Change the format of the dates so they are more user-friendly.
### 3. Conditional rendering
#### Display all the odd numbers in red font. Can you find any issues with the current markup?
### 4. API
#### Add a new endpoint into WeatherForecastController.cs.
#### It should return a list of a few strings e.g. colour names
#### Display this data as a list on this page: /api-assignment
